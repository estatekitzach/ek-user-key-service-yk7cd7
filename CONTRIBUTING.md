## Introduction

### Project Overview
The EstateKit Personal Information API is a critical encryption service designed to protect sensitive personal data through user-specific encryption keys. Due to the sensitive nature of the data we handle, we maintain extremely high security standards and strict compliance requirements.

### Security-First Approach
All contributions must prioritize security at every level:
- Encryption key management
- Data protection
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Compliance validation

### Compliance Requirements
All contributions must adhere to:
- FIPS 140-2 for cryptographic modules
- PCI DSS for payment data security
- SOC 2 for service organization control
- GDPR for data protection
- ISO 27001 for information security

### Code of Conduct
Contributors must:
- Prioritize security in all development decisions
- Report security vulnerabilities immediately
- Maintain strict confidentiality
- Follow all compliance procedures
- Participate in security reviews

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools
| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|
| .NET Core SDK | 9.0.x | Core development platform |
| Docker Desktop | 24.0+ | Container development |
| AWS CLI | 2.13+ | AWS service interaction |
| Git | 2.42+ | Version control |
| Security Scanner | Latest | Code security analysis |

### Environment Configuration
1. Install required tools with exact versions specified
2. Configure AWS CLI with appropriate permissions:
   ```bash
   aws configure --profile estatekit-dev
   ```
3. Set up local development database with encryption:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d db
   ```
4. Install security certificates:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-certificates.sh
   ```

### Security Tool Configuration
1. Configure OWASP dependency checker
2. Set up SonarQube scanner
3. Install Git hooks for security checks
4. Configure AWS KMS development credentials

## Security Requirements

### AWS KMS Integration
- Use only approved KMS API calls
- Implement key rotation as specified
- Follow least privilege principle
- Maintain key usage audit logs

### Key Management
- No hardcoded keys or secrets
- Use AWS Secrets Manager
- Implement key rotation
- Follow key lifecycle management

### Data Protection
- Encrypt all sensitive data
- Use approved encryption algorithms
- Implement secure key storage
- Follow data classification guidelines

### Security Review Process
1. Static code analysis
2. Dependency vulnerability scan
3. Infrastructure security review
4. Compliance validation
5. Penetration testing (when applicable)

## Code Standards

### C# Coding Style
- Follow Microsoft C# coding conventions
- Use latest C# 12.0 features appropriately
- Implement nullable reference types
- Use secure coding patterns

### Security-First API Design
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting implementation
- Authentication for all routes
- Proper error handling
- Secure logging practices

### AWS Security Best Practices
- Use IAM roles and policies
- Implement VPC security
- Enable AWS CloudTrail
- Configure AWS Config rules

## Contribution Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- main: Production code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/SEC-*: Security features
- hotfix/SEC-*: Security patches

### Commit Requirements
- Sign all commits with GPG
- Include security review tags
- Reference security tickets
- Follow conventional commits

### Pull Request Process
1. Complete security checklist
2. Pass all CI/CD checks
3. Obtain required reviews:
   - 1 review for general changes
   - 2 reviews for security changes
   - 2 reviews for infrastructure changes
   - 3 reviews for key management changes

### Security Review Requirements
